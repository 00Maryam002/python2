# What does this program do?

1.This program processes an image to divide it into 9 smaller images, each of size 100×100 pixels. Here's what happens step by step:

2.Resize Input Image: The program first checks the dimensions of the input image. If it's not 900×900 pixels, it resizes it to ensure it matches the required dimensions.

3.Create Empty Output Images: Nine blank images of size 100×100 are created, which will be populated with data extracted from the original image.

4.Apply a 3×3 Matrix as a Sliding Filter: A 3×3 filter (or matrix) slides over the 900×900 image, moving 3 pixels at a time horizontally and vertically. At each step:

+The top-left pixel from the 3×3 block is selected.
+This pixel's value is placed in the corresponding location in one of the 100×100 output images.

5.Repeat for All Output Images: The process is repeated 9 times, each time selecting a different pixel within the 3×3 block as the representative pixel for the current output image.

6.Display the Images: Finally, the original image and the 9 generated images are displayed.

# How to use this program?

1.Install Required Library: Ensure you have the Pillow library installed, which is used for image processing. Run the following command in your environment to install it:
pip install pillow
2.Run the Program: Execute the program in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab. When prompted:
 
 +Enter the full file path of the input image you want to process.
 
3.View the Results: After processing, 9 smaller images will pop up one by one, showing the divided parts of the original image.

# Example Workflow

1.Input: Suppose you provide an image example.jpg that is 1200×1200. The program will resize it to 900×900.

2.Processing: The program divides the resized image into 3×3 sections. For each section, a 3×3 filter will:

+Extract specific pixels (starting with the top-left).
+Map those pixels into one of the 100×100 images.

3.Output: You will see the original image and the 9 smaller images representing different views of the original image.

# What is this program useful for?

This program can be helpful for:
+Image preprocessing in machine learning or computer vision tasks.
+Breaking down images for analysis or reconstruction.
+Visualizing how sliding window filters process images.
